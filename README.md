Hello, Welcome!

	As a Python learner, I was thinking about what will be my capstone project! It was a hard part of brainstorming to find out the real-life problem and make a solution for that. Then finally, I realize to develop an application that will me to get all of my family's important tasks in one place, for example, my wife's(pregnant) doctor's checkup, my daughter's (1-Year-old) children's hospital visit and health checkup information, my meetings or any kind of important tasks, etc. First I tried to make a Task Manager. Subsequently, I tried to explore a bit of GUI application. In addition, I tried to look into very basic web scraping. Afterward, I decided to integrate Voice Assistant feature into the GUI application.


Personal Assistant Program:
	- This is a Python program that functions as a personal assistant.
	- It provides various features such as task management, web scraping, and voice command recognition.

Setup and Usage:
	- Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system.
	- Install the further required dependencies and libraries.
	- Run the program:
	- The program will launch a GUI window with different sections for task management, web scraping, and voice command.

Features:
	i. Task Management:
	- To create a new task, enter the description and due date in the respective input fields and click the "Create Task" button.
	- To view all tasks, click the "Show All Tasks" button.
	- To edit a task, click the "Edit Task" button and follow the instructions in the dialog window.
	- To delete a task, click the "Delete Task" button and follow the instructions in the dialog window.

	ii. Web Scraping:
	- To scrape a website, click the "Scrape Website" button. The scraped data will be displayed in the text area.

	iii. Voice Command:
	- Click the "Voice Command" button to activate the voice assistant. You can give voice commands for tasks such say 'hello' for greetings, saying 'time' to get the 	current time, saying 'study' to get study information, saying 'joke' for getting funny jokes, and saying 'exit' to finish the conversation and out from the GUI 	application.

Desktop Application creation: 
	-To get .exe file is an executable file format commonly used in Windows operating systems. Please run the below command:
		python -m PyInstaller GUI_WebScrap_AI.py --onefile 

Thanks!
