Here's a pseudocode representation of my program:

Import the required modules and libraries (tkinter, messagebox, ScrolledText, BeautifulSoup, requests, json, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, datetime, pywhatkit, sys, pyjokes).

Define a class called Task with attributes: description and due_date.

Define a class called TaskManager with methods to add, delete, edit, get all tasks, load tasks from a file, and save tasks to a file.

Define a class called WebScraper with a constructor that takes a URL and a scrape method to extract information from the webpage.

Define a class called VoiceAssistant with methods to initialize the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines, listen for voice commands, and perform various actions based on the commands.

Define a class called PersonalAssistantGUI to create a graphical user interface using tkinter.

Implement the create_gui method to create the task management, web scraping, and voice assistant sections in the GUI.

Implement the create_task method to create a new task by taking input from the user and adding it to the task manager.

Implement the show_all_tasks method to display all the tasks stored in the task manager.

Implement the edit_task method to allow the user to edit an existing task by selecting the task number and providing new details.

Implement the delete_task method to allow the user to delete a task by selecting the task number and confirming the deletion.

Implement the scrape_website method to scrape a specified webpage using the WebScraper class and display the scraped data in the GUI.

Implement the voice_command method to activate the voice assistant and listen for voice commands. Perform actions based on the recognized commands.

Implement the clear_task_entries method to clear the task description and due date entry fields in the GUI.

Instantiate the PersonalAssistantGUI class and run the GUI by calling the run method.
